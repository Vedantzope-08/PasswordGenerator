# PasswordGenerator
This C++ program utilizes standard library headers for input/output and random number generation. It prompts the user to input their first name, last name, birthdate, birth month, and birth year. Using this input, it generates a random password based on multiple different patterns, combining user-provided strings with randomly selected characters and strings. The generated password is displayed to the user, who can choose to generate another password or exit. It also saves the password generated to the file named "Pass" which is text file in the if someone is for his/her password The program's space complexity is primarily determined by the length of user input strings, while its time complexity depends on the number of loop iterations and user inputÂ processing.

# Important Functions
rand() function is an inbuilt function in C++ STL, which is defined in header file <cstdlib>. rand() is used to generate a series of random numbers. The random number is generated by using an algorithm that gives a series of non-related numbers whenever this function is called. The rand() function is used in C++ to generate random numbers in the range [0, RAND_MAX).

RAND_MAX: It is a constant whose default value may vary between implementations but it is granted to be at least 32767.
