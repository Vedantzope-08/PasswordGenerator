# PasswordGenerator
This C++ program utilizes standard library headers for input/output and random number generation. It prompts the user to input their first name, last name, birthdate, birth month, and birth year. Using this input, it generates a random password based on multiple different patterns, combining user-provided strings with randomly selected characters and strings. The generated password is displayed to the user, who can choose to generate another password or exit. The program's space complexity is primarily determined by the length of user input strings, while its time complexity depends on the number of loop iterations and user inputÂ processing.
